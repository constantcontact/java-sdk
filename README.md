# Constant Contact Java SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/constantcontact/java-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/constantcontact/java-sdk) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/constantcontact/maven/java-sdk/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/constantcontact/maven/java-sdk/_latestVersion)
Java and Android library for accessing the Constant Contact API. Based on the [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) framework.

## Usage
You'll need an API key and access token to use the SDK. Do so by creating a developer account [here](https://constantcontact.mashery.com/member/register), then register an app to generate an API key and access token for an account.

Then, start by creating the ```CCApi2``` object, and make the call you need through the appropriate service. Learn more about signing up 
for a developer account [here](https://developer.constantcontact.com/api-keys.html).

All of the calls respond with Retrofit ```Call``` objects, which can be consumed synchronously (```execute```) or 
asynchronously (```enqueue```). Full documentation of the ```Call``` class can be found [here](https://square.github.io/retrofit/2.x/retrofit/retrofit2/Call.html).

Each service is fully documented in the [Javadoc](http://constantcontact.github.io/java-sdk/) with full explanations of each parameter.

#### Get Account Information (Synchronous Example)
```java
CCApi2 api = new CCApi2("your_api_key", "your_access_token");
try {
    AccountSummaryInformation accountSummary = api.getAccountService()
                                                  .getAccountSummaryInformation()
                                                  .execute()
                                                  .body();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

#### Get Contact Collection (Asynchronous Example)
```java
CCApi2 api = new CCApi2("your_api_key", "your_access_token");
Callback<Paged<Contact>> callback = new Callback<Paged<Contact>>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Response<Paged<Contact>> response) {
        List<Contact> contacts = response.body().getResults();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
    }
}
api.getContactService().getContacts(50, ContactStatus.ACTIVE).enqueue(callback);
```

## Installation
The JAR is available on [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter), or you can download manually from 
the [releases page](https://github.com/constantcontact/java-sdk/releases). Note, if you download manually,
you will also need to download the Components JAR and include it in your build file.

### Artifacts
The base library is the `java-sdk` artifact. If you use RxJava there are two artifacts available depending on the version:
`java-sdk-rx` for RxJava 1 users and `java-sdk-rx2` for RxJava 2 users (all calls return `Observable`).

#### Gradle - Release
```groovy
compile 'com.constantcontact:java-sdk:5.2.2'
```
#### Gradle - Snapshot
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven("https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/")
    }
}
compile 'com.constantcontact:java-sdk:X.X.X-SNAPSHOT'
```

#### Maven
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.constantcontact</groupId>
        <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Release Process
There's an automated build process set up for the various build types that can occur, based on where code is pushed or merged.

1. When a PR is opened, or pushed to, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/constantcontact/java-sdk) will run a PR build which then reports the status back to the 
GitHub PR. If any unit tests fail, the PR will not be mergable until they are fixed.
2. When a PR is merged to master, or if there's a push to master, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/constantcontact/java-sdk) will run a regular build with test,
and then automatically deploy a SNAPSHOT build to https://oss.jfrog.org (a.k.a. OJO). These builds can be found
[here](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/com/constantcontact/).
3. When a tag is applied to a commit that follows the format '#.#.#', 
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/constantcontact/java-sdk) will run a release build, and then upload to the 
[Bintray](https://bintray.com/constantcontact/maven) maven repo (which also automatically deploys to JCenter),
as well as creates a draft release [here](https://github.com/constantcontact/java-sdk/releases). 
    1. In order for the Bintray release to become visible, the uploads must be made public. The Bintray maven
    dashboard page will have a node that there are 16 or so unreleased files with a publish link. Click publish
    to release it.
    2. Likewise, the GitHub release is generated as a draft. Edit the draft, add notes about the changes and
    click publish to make it visible to developers.
